Welcome to my TO-DO List manager app.
In this file I will provide directions on how each function in the app works.

1. The "Add" button located in the top left corner of the app will add a list to the app if and only if the user
   has entered a name for the list in the text field next to it.
   
2. The "Edit" button located on the bottom left corner will edit the name of the list selected by the user if and
   only if the user has enter a new name for the list in the text field next to it.
   
3. The "Remove List" button will remove the list selected by the user from the app. If a list is removed all the tasks
   in this list will be removed too.
   
4. The "Export Selected" button will export the list selected by the user in the form of a new text file created in the
   desktop of the user.
   
5. The "Import and TODO List" button will import a list a text file from the user into the app. The list will be imported
   with its corresponding tasks.
   
6. The "Add" button in the top center of the app will add a new task to the list selected by the user if and only if a name
   for the user has entered a name for the task in the text field next to it. If the user has not picked a date for the task
   in the date picker next to the this button today's date will be used as a default.
   
7. The "Edit" button on the bottom center of the app will edit the name and date of the task selected by the user if and only
   if the user has entered a new name for the task in the text field next to it. If the user has not picked a new date for the 
   task in the date picker next to this button today's date will be used as a default.
   
8. The "Set Complete/Incomplete" button will change the status of the task selected by the user to complete if incomplete or 
   viceversa. 
   
9. The "Remove Task" button will remove the task selected by the user from the list it is in.

10. The "View All Tasks" button will show all tasks in the list selected by the user if the user has gone into view completed or
   view not completed mode.
   
11. The "View Completed" button will show only the completed tasks in the list selected by the user. This action will disable 
    certain functions that will be re-enabled once the user goes back to viewing all tasks or selects a new list.
    
12. The "View Completed" button will show only the incomplete tasks in the list selected by the user. This action will disable 
    certain functions that will be re-enabled once the user goes back to viewing all tasks or selects a new list.
